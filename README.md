# Etch-a-Sketch

This project will go test my HTML/CSS/JS skills up to this point. I have most recently learned DOM Manipulation in JS.
This project will follow TOP Web Dev 101 Project: Etch a sketch at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav .
